# Task2
 Identify phishing characteristics in a suspicious email sample
 
 What I Did

1.Created and analyzed a sample phishing email using .eml format.

2.Investigated sender spoofing and email domain authenticity using WHOIS lookup.

3.Identified suspicious links using command-line tools and external services like VirusTotal.

4.Detected red flags such as:

Urgent or threatening tone

Generic greetings (e.g., "Dear user")

Mismatched display URLs vs real URLs

Poor grammar and spelling

Wrote a structured analysis report documenting all phishing indicators.

 # What I Learned
 
:- Phishing Techniques: Understood how spoofed emails use psychological tactics like urgency or fear to manipulate users.

:- Header & Link Analysis: Gained hands-on experience in reading raw email content and analyzing embedded URLs.

:- Threat Awareness: Learned how to spot subtle phishing indicators that often go unnoticed.

# Tools Used:

Kali Linux built-in utilities (grep, nano, curl, whois)

Online tools: VirusTotal, MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer
